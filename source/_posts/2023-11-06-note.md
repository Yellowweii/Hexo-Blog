# Thoughts and feelings on the morning of November 6th

- Firstly, it is necessary to acknowledge a fact: one's own abilities still need to be continuously improved, and the resume still needs to be continuously optimized.
- Now I need to consider whether to use the techniques I have learned to create a more perfect website or start learning Flutter and Dart now.
- The mastery of frame-motion is still very poor. Basically, I follow the videos and can't make a good animation myself.
- There is still a long way to go before a big company, and resumes need to be constantly iterated and optimized.
