# Talk about some difficulties I encountered in my study

- After having a certain understanding of React , Tailwindcss, Next.js and Frame-motion, I completed a website with animation effects according to the video of Youtube, but for me, how to show the technology applied to my resume There is still a certain difficulty.
- Completed several websites using Next.js, but still not deployed to the pagoda panel, only deployed on the Vercel platform.
- Research is needed on how to write the project experience module on the resume.
- The content to be learned next and the arrangements for the future are not yet very clear.
