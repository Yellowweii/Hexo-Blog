# What I saw, heard and felt today

- I think any extreme means of dealing with problems is not advisable, just like dealing with interpersonal relationships. It is not advisable to compromise and please others, nor is it advisable to persist in oneself and ignore the interests of others. Only by achieving a balance can interpersonal relationships be handled well.
- I think we need to stick to our own views and positions, and invest our patience and time for worthy people and things. Because it's impossible to make everyone like you, there's no need to please others too much, just stop when necessary.
- Confidence comes from within oneself. I believe that no matter what others think of you, only by believing in yourself can you live your life and not be influenced by the opinions of those around you.
